# Jammming! :musical_note:
Ready to rock? With Jammming!, you can search for your favorite songs, create playlists, and export them to [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/)!

This project was created to demonstrate understanding of React and its many features, including use of hooks and components. This project also demonstrates integration of APIs. Users are able to look up Spotify tracks by name, artist, or album, preview tracks, add tracks to a playlist, customize the playlist name, description, and cover, and export the playlist to their connected Spotify account. Note that the Jammming! web app is currently for **demonstrative purposes only**, and Spotify integration and functionality will be added in a later update.

## :notes: Features

## :notes: Acknowledgements
This project was based off of [Sypher12233](https://github.com/Sypher12233)'s guide for the Jammming project on Codecademy, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Sypher12233/CC_jammming?tab=readme-ov-file#jammming-guides). The video tutorial and step-by-step guide really helped me understand the fundamentals of this project, so I would like to extend my thanks!

I also would like to shout out [marcelczubak](https://github.com/marcelczubak)'s web app [TuneFetch](https://github.com/marcelczubak/tune-fetch/tree/main), as it inspired the layout change in v0.2.0.
